      "question": "What is an array in C++?",
      "options": [
        "A single variable that stores one value",
        "A collection of values of same data type",
        "A function that performs calculations",
        "A loop structure for repetition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An array is a collection of values of the same data type stored in continuous memory locations. It allows you to store multiple values under a single name, accessed using indices."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which is the correct syntax for declaring an integer array of size 10?",
      "options": [
        "int array[10];",
        "array int[10];",
        "int[10] array;",
        "array[10] int;"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax for declaring an array is: datatype array_name[size]; So for an integer array of size 10, it would be 'int array[10];'"
    },

        "It depends on the programmer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In C++, array indexing starts from 0. So for an array of size n, the valid indices are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What will be the valid indices for an array declared as int A[5]?",
      "options": [
        "A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4], A[5]",
        "A[0], A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4]",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Arrays are initialized using curly braces {} with elements separated by commas. The syntax is: type array_name[size] = {element1, element2, ...};"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What happens if you declare int A[] = {1,2,3,4,5}; without specifying the size?",
      "options": [
        "Compilation error occurs",
        "The compiler automatically sets the size to 5",
        "The array size becomes unlimited",
        "The array size is set to 0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When you initialize an array without specifying the size, the compiler automatically counts the number of elements and sets the array size accordingly. In this case, it would be 5."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What are the main operations that can be performed on arrays?",

        "Hash search",
        "Tree search"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Linear (or sequential) search works on unsorted arrays. It checks each element one by one from the beginning until the target element is found or the end is reached."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which searching method requires the array to be sorted?",
      "options": [
        "Linear search",

        "It is easier to implement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Binary search is much faster than linear search for large arrays. Each comparison eliminates half of the remaining elements, making it very efficient with O(log n) time complexity."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "In binary search, how is the mid position calculated?",
      "options": [
        "mid = (initial + final) / 2",
        "mid = initial + final",
        "mid = final - initial",
        "mid = initial * final / 2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In binary search, the mid position is calculated as mid = (initial + final) / 2, where initial and final are the starting and ending indices of the current search range."
    },

        "Counting the number of elements"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sorting means arranging the elements of an array in a specific order, either ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest)."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "In bubble sort, what happens during each pass?",
      "options": [
        "The smallest element moves to the beginning",
        "The largest element moves to its correct position",
        "All elements are compared once",
        "The array is divided into two parts"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In bubble sort, during each pass, adjacent elements are compared and swapped if necessary, causing the largest element to 'bubble up' to its correct position at the end."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "How many passes are required in bubble sort for an array of N elements?",

        "N+1 passes",
        "2N passes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bubble sort requires N-1 passes for an array of N elements. After N-1 passes, all elements will be in their correct positions."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is the key principle of selection sort?",
      "options": [
        "Compare adjacent elements and swap",
        "Divide the array into two parts",
        "Select the smallest element and place it in correct position",
        "Insert elements one by one in correct position"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Selection sort works by finding the smallest element and placing it in the first position, then finding the second smallest and placing it in the second position, and so on."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What does insertion operation in arrays mean?",
      "options": [

      "id": 18,
      "question": "When inserting an element at a specific position in an array, what must be done first?",
      "options": [
        "Delete the last element",
        "Sort the entire array",
        "Shift elements to make space",
        "Clear the array"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When inserting an element at a specific position, you must first shift all elements from that position onwards to the right to make space for the new element."

        "Sorting the array",
        "Finding the maximum element"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Deletion involves removing an element from the array and then shifting all subsequent elements to the left to fill the gap created by the deleted element."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "How do you declare an array of strings in C++?",
      "options": [
        "string array[10];",
        "char array[10];",
        "char array[10][20];",
        "Both options 2 and 3 are correct"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Arrays of strings can be declared as char array[10]; for a single string or char array[10][20]; for multiple strings. An array of strings is essentially an array of characters."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "What character automatically terminates a string in C++?",
      "options": [
        "'\\n'",
        "'\\t'",
        "'\\0'",
        "'\\r'"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The null character '\\0' automatically terminates a string in C++. The compiler automatically places this character at the end of string constants."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Which is the correct way to declare a character array for storing a name?",
      "options": [

        "char name[6] = {'G','A','U','R','A','V','\\0'};",
        "char name[] = \"GAURAV\";",
        "Both options 2 and 3 are correct"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Both ways are correct. You can explicitly include '\\0' or use double quotes which automatically adds the null terminator. Note that for 'GAURAV' you need 7 characters including '\\0'."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "How do you declare a two-dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns of integers?",

      "question": "What happens during the insertion operation when the array is full?",
      "options": [
        "The operation completes successfully",
        "The last element is removed automatically",
        "An overflow condition occurs",
        "The array size doubles automatically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When trying to insert into a full array, an overflow condition occurs. Since arrays have fixed size, you cannot add more elements beyond the declared capacity."

      "question": "Which of the following represents correct array bounds for int A[5][3]?",
      "options": [
        "Rows: 0-4, Columns: 0-2",
        "Rows: 1-5, Columns: 1-3",
        "Rows: 0-5, Columns: 0-3",
        "Rows: 1-4, Columns: 1-2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "For array int A[5][3], there are 5 rows (indices 0-4) and 3 columns (indices 0-2). Array indexing starts from 0 in C++."

      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using arrays?",
      "options": [
        "They can store unlimited data",
        "They provide fast random access to elements",
        "They automatically sort data",
        "They use very little memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The primary advantage of arrays is fast random access to elements using indices. Any element can be accessed directly in O(1) time using its index."

      "question": "In bubble sort, after the first pass through an array of n elements, what is guaranteed?",
      "options": [
        "The smallest element is in its correct position",
        "The largest element is in its correct position",
        "Half the array is sorted",
        "The array is completely sorted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "After the first pass in bubble sort, the largest element is guaranteed to be in its correct position (at the end). Each subsequent pass places the next largest element in its correct position."

      "question": "Which operation typically requires shifting of array elements?",
      "options": [
        "Accessing an element",
        "Searching for an element",
        "Inserting an element at a specific position",
        "Finding the maximum element"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Inserting an element at a specific position requires shifting all elements from that position onwards to make space for the new element. This ensures the array remains contiguous."

      "question": "What is the space complexity of most array operations?",
      "options": [
        "O(1)",
        "O(log n)",
        "O(n)",
        "O(n²)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Most basic array operations like access, insertion, deletion have O(1) space complexity as they don't require additional space proportional to the input size. They work with the existing array memory."
