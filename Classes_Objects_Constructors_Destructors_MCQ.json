      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When the object is created with parameterized constructor, we must supply arguments. The statement 'student S1(1, 70);' is the shorter and commonly used method."

        "A friend function"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Destructor is used to destroy the objects that have been created by a constructor. The destructor is a member function whose name is the same as the class name but is preceded by a tilde."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "A destructor is preceded by which symbol?",

      "id": 23,
      "question": "What happens if no constructor is defined in a class?",
      "options": [

        "In the constructor only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The member functions are created and placed in the memory space only once when they are defined in class specification. All the objects belonging to that class use the same member functions."
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "How is memory allocated for member variables?",
      "options": [

        "Allocated only once"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Space for member variable is allocated separately for each object because member variable holds different value for different objects."
    },

      "id": 28,
      "question": "Which of the following creates an array of objects?",
      "options": [
