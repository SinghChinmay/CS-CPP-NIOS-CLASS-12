      "options": [
        "Base 10",
        "Base 2",
        "Base 8",
        "Base 16"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Binary number system has base 2 because all numbers are generated by a combination of only two digits: 0 and 1. This is why computers use binary - they work with two states (ON/OFF, HIGH/LOW voltage)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a valid binary number?",
      "options": [

        "1201",
        "0111"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "1201 is not a valid binary number because binary numbers can only contain digits 0 and 1. The digit '2' is not part of the binary number system. Binary works with base 2, using only two digits."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "To convert (1001)₂ to decimal: (1×2³) + (0×2²) + (0×2¹) + (1×2⁰) = (1×8) + (0×4) + (0×2) + (1×1) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9. Each position represents a power of 2, starting from 2⁰ on the right."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "LSB stands for Least Significant Bit. It is the rightmost bit in a binary number and has the smallest place value (2⁰ = 1). In the binary number 1001, the rightmost '1' is the LSB."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "MSB stands for Most Significant Bit. It is the leftmost bit in a binary number and has the largest place value. In the binary number 1001, the leftmost '1' is the MSB with a value of 2³ = 8."
    },

        "Subtract 2 from 9"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The first step in decimal to binary conversion is to divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder. For 9: 9÷2 = 4 with remainder 1. Continue dividing until quotient becomes 0, then read remainders from bottom to top to get the binary number."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,

        "Base 10",
        "Base 16"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Octal number system has base 8 because it uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It was previously a popular choice for representing digital circuit numbers in a more compact form than binary."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "To convert (23)₈ to decimal: (2×8¹) + (3×8⁰) = (2×8) + (3×1) = 16 + 3 = 19. Each position in an octal number represents a power of 8, starting from 8⁰ on the right."

        "19 ÷ 16 = 1 remainder 3"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When converting decimal to octal, divide by 8. First step: 19÷8 = 2 with remainder 3 (this is the LSB). Next step: 2÷8 = 0 with remainder 2 (this is the MSB). Reading from bottom to top: (23)₈."

        "Base 12",
        "Base 16"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hexadecimal number system has base 16. It uses sixteen symbols: digits 0-9 for values zero through nine, and letters A-F (or a-f) for values ten through fifteen. It is currently the most popular choice for compact representation of binary data."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In hexadecimal, the letter 'E' (or 'e') represents the decimal value 14. The hexadecimal digits are: 0-9 represent values 0-9, A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "To convert (E5)₁₆ to decimal: E=14 and 5=5. So (14×16¹) + (5×16⁰) = (14×16) + (5×1) = 224 + 5 = 229. Each position represents a power of 16, starting from 16⁰ on the right."

        "229 ÷ 10 = 22 remainder 9"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When converting decimal to hexadecimal, divide by 16. First step: 229÷16 = 14 remainder 5 (LSB). Next: 14÷16 = 0 remainder 14. Since 14 in hex is 'E', the result is (E5)₁₆."

        "11110"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "One's complement is obtained by changing all 0's to 1's and all 1's to 0's. For 11001: change 1→0, 1→0, 0→1, 0→1, 1→0, resulting in 00110. This is a simple bit-flip operation."

        "Four"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Most logic gates have two inputs and only one output. While gates can be designed with more inputs, the standard logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR) typically operate with two input signals to produce one output signal."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An AND gate outputs 1 (true) only when ALL inputs are 1. If A=1 and B=1, then A·B=1. If any input is 0, the output is 0. The AND gate implements logical multiplication."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "An AND gate outputs 0 if at least one input is 0. Whether it's A=0, B=1 or A=1, B=0, the output is always 0. The AND gate only outputs 1 when ALL inputs are 1. This represents logical AND operation."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "With 8 bits, you can represent 2⁸ = 256 different values (from 0 to 255). Each bit doubles the number of possible values. 8 bits is called a byte and is fundamental in computing for representing characters (ASCII) and small numbers."
