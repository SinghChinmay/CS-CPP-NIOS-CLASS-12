  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What symbol is used to terminate every statement in C++?",
      "options": [
        "Colon (:)",
        "Semicolon (;)",
        "Period (.)",
        "Comma (,)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In C++, every statement must be terminated with a semicolon (;). This tells the compiler where one statement ends and the next begins."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following symbols are used to enclose a compound statement in C++?",
      "options": [
        "Square brackets [ ]",
        "Parentheses ( )",
        "Curly braces { }",
        "Angle brackets < >"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Compound statements in C++ are enclosed in curly braces { }. The opening brace { marks the beginning and the closing brace } marks the end of the block."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is a null statement in C++?",
      "options": [
        "A statement with no variables",
        "A statement containing only a semicolon (;)",
        "A statement with zero value",
        "An empty function"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A null statement in C++ is simply a semicolon (;) by itself. It's useful when the syntax requires a statement but the logic doesn't need any action to be performed."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a conditional statement in C++?",
      "options": [
        "if statement",
        "if-else statement",
        "switch statement",
        "for statement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The for statement is a loop construct, not a conditional statement. Conditional statements include if, if-else, and switch statements that make decisions based on conditions."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In an if statement, what happens when the condition is false?",
      "options": [
        "The program terminates",
        "An error occurs",
        "The statements inside the if block are skipped",
        "The statements are executed anyway"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When the condition in an if statement evaluates to false, the statements inside the if block are skipped and execution continues with the next statement after the if block."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the correct syntax for an if-else statement?",
      "options": [
        "if (condition) { statement1; } else { statement2; }",
        "if condition { statement1; } else { statement2; }",
        "if (condition) statement1; else statement2;",
        "Both A and C are correct"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Both syntaxes are correct in C++. You can use braces for compound statements or omit them for single statements. The condition must always be enclosed in parentheses."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "In the given code: `if (x == 5)`, what does the double equals (==) operator do?",
      "options": [
        "Assigns the value 5 to x",
        "Checks if x is equal to 5",
        "Adds 5 to x",
        "Subtracts 5 from x"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The double equals (==) is a comparison operator that checks for equality. It returns true if x equals 5, false otherwise. Single equals (=) is for assignment."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is a nested if statement?",
      "options": [
        "An if statement inside another if statement",
        "Multiple if statements in sequence",
        "An if statement with multiple conditions",
        "An if statement without else"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A nested if statement is an if statement that is placed inside another if or else statement. This allows for more complex decision-making logic in programs."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which statement allows multiple branching in C++?",
      "options": [
        "if statement",
        "if-else statement",
        "switch statement",
        "nested if statement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The switch statement allows multiple branching by testing a variable against many values (cases). It's more efficient than multiple if-else statements for checking multiple discrete values."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "In a switch statement, what is the purpose of the break statement?",
      "options": [
        "To exit the program",
        "To transfer control to the end of the switch statement",
        "To restart the switch statement",
        "To check the next case"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The break statement in a switch case transfers control to the end of the switch statement, preventing execution from falling through to subsequent cases."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What happens if you omit the break statement in a switch case?",
      "options": [
        "Compilation error occurs",
        "The program terminates",
        "Execution continues to the next case statements",
        "Nothing happens"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Without a break statement, execution falls through to the next case. This means all subsequent cases will execute until a break is encountered or the switch ends."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is executed when no case matches in a switch statement?",
      "options": [
        "The first case",
        "The last case",
        "The default case",
        "Nothing is executed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The default case is executed when none of the explicit cases match the switch expression. It acts as a catch-all for unhandled values."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which of the following is a loop construct in C++?",
      "options": [
        "while loop",
        "do-while loop",
        "for loop",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "C++ provides three types of loop constructs: while loop, do-while loop, and for loop. Each has different characteristics for different use cases."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "In a while loop, when is the condition checked?",
      "options": [
        "After each execution of the loop body",
        "Before each execution of the loop body",
        "Only at the beginning",
        "Only at the end"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In a while loop, the condition is checked before each execution of the loop body. If the condition is false initially, the loop body never executes."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is the main difference between while and do-while loops?",
      "options": [
        "while loop runs faster",
        "do-while loop executes the loop body at least once",
        "while loop can have multiple conditions",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The do-while loop executes the loop body at least once because the condition is checked after the loop body execution, unlike the while loop where condition is checked first."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "In a do-while loop, where is the condition placed?",
      "options": [
        "Before the loop body",
        "After the loop body",
        "Inside the loop body",
        "Outside the loop"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In a do-while loop, the condition is placed after the loop body. The syntax is: do { statements; } while (condition);"
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Which loop is best suited when you know in advance how many times the loop should execute?",
      "options": [
        "while loop",
        "do-while loop",
        "for loop",
        "All loops are equally suitable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The for loop is best for count-controlled loops where you know the number of iterations in advance. It combines initialization, condition, and increment in one statement."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What are the three operations performed in a for loop?",
      "options": [
        "Input, process, output",
        "Start, middle, end",
        "Initialization, condition testing, increment/decrement",
        "Declaration, assignment, comparison"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A for loop has three parts: initialization (executed once), condition testing (before each iteration), and increment/decrement (after each iteration)."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Which of the following is a jump statement in C++?",
      "options": [
        "goto statement",
        "break statement",
        "continue statement",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Jump statements transfer control unconditionally. C++ has goto (jumps to label), break (exits loop/switch), and continue (skips to next iteration)."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What does the goto statement do?",
      "options": [
        "Exits the program",
        "Transfers control to a labeled statement",
        "Repeats the current statement",
        "Skips the next statement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The goto statement unconditionally transfers program control to a labeled statement elsewhere in the program. However, it's considered poor programming practice."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "What is the difference between break and continue statements?",
      "options": [
        "break exits the loop, continue skips to the next iteration",
        "continue exits the loop, break skips to the next iteration",
        "They perform the same function",
        "break is for loops, continue is for switch statements"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "break exits the entire loop or switch statement, while continue skips the remaining statements in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Which header file is required for using the exit() function?",
      "options": [
        "iostream.h",
        "stdio.h",
        "process.h",
        "conio.h"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The exit() function is declared in process.h header file. It terminates the program execution and returns a status code to the operating system."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "What value should be passed to exit() function for correct execution?",
      "options": [
        "1",
        "-1",
        "0",
        "Any positive number"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "By convention, exit(0) indicates successful program termination. Non-zero values typically indicate various error conditions."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Consider the code: `int c; float a = 245.05, b = 40.02; c = a + b;` What will be the value of c?",

        "2850",
        "285",
        "285.0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When assigning a float result to an int variable, the decimal part is truncated (not rounded). So 285.07 becomes 285."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "What will be the output of: `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) cout << i;`",

        "12345",
        "0123",
        "1234"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The loop starts with i=0, continues while i<5, and increments i after each iteration. So it prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4."
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "In the statement `while (n <= 10)`, what is n called?",

        "Counter variable",
        "Index variable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The variable used to control loop execution is called a loop control variable. Its value determines when the loop starts and stops."

        "while loop",
        "do-while loop",
        "All loops guarantee this"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Only the do-while loop guarantees at least one execution because it checks the condition after executing the loop body, not before."
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "What does the increment operator (++) do?",
      "options": [
        "Increases the value by 10",

        "default case",
        "No case is executed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The default case is executed when none of the explicit case values match the switch expression. It's optional but recommended for handling unexpected values."
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "What is the purpose of compound statements in C++?",
      "options": [
        "To group multiple statements together",
        "To make the code run faster",
        "To reduce memory usage",
        "To handle errors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Compound statements, enclosed in curly braces {}, group multiple statements together to be treated as a single unit, especially useful in control structures."
    },

        "+=",
        "!="
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The single equals sign (=) is the assignment operator in C++. Don't confuse it with == (equality comparison) or += (compound assignment)."
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "What happens in this code: `total += n;`?",
      "options": [
        "total is assigned the value of n",
        "total is added to n",
        "n is added to total",
        "total and n are compared"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The += operator is a compound assignment operator. `total += n` is equivalent to `total = total + n`, so n is added to total."

      "question": "What happens when you use goto statement in a program?",
      "options": [
        "It improves program efficiency",
        "It's considered good programming practice",
        "It transfers control unconditionally",
        "It creates a loop"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The goto statement transfers control unconditionally to a labeled statement. However, it's generally considered poor programming practice as it can make code hard to follow."

      "question": "What is the main disadvantage of using goto statements?",
      "options": [
        "They are slow",
        "They use more memory",
        "They make code difficult to understand and maintain",
        "They don't work in C++"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The main problem with goto is that it can create 'spaghetti code' - programs that are hard to read, understand, debug, and maintain because control flow jumps around unpredictably."

        "Increment/decrement",
        "Loop body"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The initialization part of a for loop is executed only once at the beginning. The condition is checked before each iteration, and increment/decrement happens after each iteration."

      "question": "What does the expression `number /= 10;` do?",
      "options": [
        "Multiplies number by 10",
        "Divides number by 10 and stores result in number",
        "Adds 10 to number",
        "Finds remainder of number divided by 10"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The /= operator is a compound assignment operator. `number /= 10` is equivalent to `number = number / 10`, so it divides number by 10 and stores the result back in number."
