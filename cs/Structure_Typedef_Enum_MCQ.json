      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax to access a nested structure member is using dot operators: b.date_of_birth.month. This accesses the 'month' member of the 'date_of_birth' structure within 'b'."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "How do you initialize a nested structure?",

        "existing_datatype typedef new_datatype;"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The general syntax of typedef is: typedef existing_datatype new_datatype; For example: typedef float real; creates 'real' as an alternative name for 'float'."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "After the statement 'typedef float real;', which declaration is valid?",
      "options": [
        "real amount;",
        "float amount;",
        "Both options 1 and 2 are valid",
        "Neither option is valid"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "After 'typedef float real;', both 'real amount;' and 'float amount;' are valid declarations. 'real' becomes an alternative name for 'float', so both can be used interchangeably."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using typedef?",
      "options": [
        "It increases program speed",

        "It creates new data types"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The main advantage of typedef is that it provides self-documenting code by allowing descriptive names for standard data types, making the code more readable and understandable."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is an enumerated data type?",
      "options": [
        "A built-in data type",
        "A user-defined datatype with a finite list of values",
        "A type for storing large numbers",
        "A type for storing arrays"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Enumerated data type is a user-defined datatype that works when you know in advance a finite list of values that a data type can take. It defines a set of named constants."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,

        "enumtype"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'enum' keyword is used to create an enumerated data type. For example: enum months { jan, feb, mar, apr, may };"
    },
    {

        "3",
        "4"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In enum, the first member gets value 0, second gets 1, and so on. So jan=0, feb=1, mar=2, apr=3, may=4. Therefore, 'mar' has the value 2."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "How are enum members stored internally?",
      "options": [

        "5",
        "6"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When jan is explicitly set to 1, the subsequent values follow: jan=1, feb=2, mar=3, apr=4, may=5. Each next element gets the previous value plus one."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "In 'enum color { red, green = 5, blue };', what is the value of 'blue'?",

        "5",
        "6",
        "7",
        "3"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When green is explicitly set to 5, blue gets the next value, which is 5+1=6. So red=0, green=5, blue=6."
    },

        "Yes, both input and output are possible",
        "Only input is possible",
        "Only output is possible",
        "No, neither input nor output is possible directly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Enum values cannot be directly input by the user or output on the screen. They are used internally as integer constants for program logic and comparisons."

        "All possible values",
        "Two values"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An enum variable takes only one value out of the possible values defined in the enumeration. For example, a variable of type 'months' can hold only one month value at a time."

        "STUDENT typedef struct student;"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax is: typedef struct student STUDENT; This creates 'STUDENT' as an alternative name for 'struct student', allowing you to declare variables as 'STUDENT s1;' instead of 'struct student s1;'."

        "It assigns conventional values: false=0, true=1",
        "It prevents compilation errors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "enum boolean {false, true}; is better because it assigns conventional boolean values: false=0 and true=1, which matches the standard boolean representation in most programming languages."

      "options": [
        "No, only basic data types are allowed",
        "Yes, this creates nested structures",
        "Only if both structures are the same",
        "Only with pointers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Yes, a structure member can be of another structure type, creating nested structures. For example, a 'biodata' structure can have a 'today' structure as a member for date of birth."

      "question": "What is the difference between struct and class in C++?",
      "options": [
        "No difference",
        "struct members are public by default, class members are private",
        "struct is for data, class is for functions",
        "struct is older syntax"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In C++, the main difference between struct and class is that struct members are public by default, while class members are private by default. Otherwise, they are functionally equivalent."

      "question": "How do you declare multiple variables of the same enum type?",
      "options": [
        "enum months m1; enum months m2;",
        "months m1, m2;",
        "Both options 1 and 2 are correct",
        "month m1, m2;"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Both ways are correct: you can declare multiple enum variables separately (enum months m1; enum months m2;) or together (months m1, m2;). The second form is more concise."

      "question": "What happens if you try to assign an integer directly to an enum variable?",
      "options": [
        "It works without any issues",
        "Compilation error occurs",
        "Runtime error occurs",
        "The value is automatically converted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In C++, you cannot directly assign an integer to an enum variable without explicit casting. This would cause a compilation error because enum provides type safety."

      "question": "Which statement about structure assignment is true?",
      "options": [
        "Only individual members can be assigned",
        "Entire structure can be assigned if types match",
        "Structure assignment is not allowed",
        "Only the first member is assigned"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Entire structures can be assigned to each other if they are of the same structure type. This is called memberwise assignment, where all members are copied automatically."
