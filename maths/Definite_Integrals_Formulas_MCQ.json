      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Wallis's formula for even n: ∫[0 to π/2] sin^n x dx = [(n-1)(n-3)...1]/[n(n-2)...2] × π/2. This uses reduction formula."

      "options": ["0", "1", "∞", "Does not exist"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "∫[0 to ∞] e^(-x) dx = lim(b→∞) [-e^(-x)]₀ᵇ = lim(b→∞) (-e^(-b) + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1. This is an improper integral."

      "explanation": "Trapezoidal rule (one interval): ∫[a to b] f(x)dx ≈ (b-a)[f(a) + f(b)]/2. This approximates the area as a trapezoid."
