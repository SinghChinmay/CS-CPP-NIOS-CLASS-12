      "question": "In Young's double slit experiment, what is the role of the first pinhole S?",
      "options": [
        "To filter out certain wavelengths of light",
        "To create a monochromatic point source of light",
        "To reduce the intensity of incident light",
        "To polarize the light"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The first pinhole S serves as a point source that emits monochromatic light. When illuminated by monochromatic light, it allows the slits S1 and S2 to act as coherent sources."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is a coherent source of light?",
      "options": [
        "A source that emits light continuously",
        "Two sources that emit light of the same frequency, amplitude, with constant phase difference",
        "A source with high intensity of light",
        "A source that emits white light"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Coherent sources emit waves of the same frequency and amplitude, and maintain a constant phase difference between them. This is essential for observing a clear interference pattern."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What happens when two light waves from coherent sources superpose in phase?",
      "options": [
        "The waves cancel each other",
        "A dark fringe is observed",
        "Constructive interference occurs, producing a bright fringe",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When two light waves from coherent sources arrive in phase (phase difference = 0 or 2nπ), constructive interference occurs. The crests of one wave coincide with crests of the other, resulting in maximum displacement and a bright fringe."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is destructive interference?",
      "options": [
        "When light waves are blocked by an obstacle",
        "When the crests of one wave coincide with the troughs of another, resulting in zero intensity",
        "When light waves change their direction",
        "When the intensity of light decreases due to absorption"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Destructive interference occurs when the crests of one light wave coincide with the troughs of another wave. The phase difference is π or an odd multiple of π, resulting in zero total amplitude and a dark fringe."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "In Young's experiment, what is the phase difference for constructive interference?",
      "options": [

        "π/2, 3π/2, 5π/2, ...",
        "π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, ..."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For constructive interference, the phase difference must be δ = 0, 2π, 4π, ... = 2nπ. At these phase differences, the two waves arrive in phase, producing maximum intensity."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,

      "options": [
        "0, 2π, 4π, ...",
        "π, 3π, 5π, ... = (2n+1)π",
        "π/2, 3π/2, ...",
        "Any value less than π"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For destructive interference, the phase difference must be δ = π, 3π, 5π, ... = (2n+1)π. At these values, the crests of one wave coincide with the troughs of the other, producing zero intensity."
    },
    {

        "The square of the amplitude of the resultant wave",
        "The distance between the slits",
        "The speed of light"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The intensity of light is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave, I ∝ A². This is why bright fringes (high amplitude) have much higher intensity than dark fringes (zero amplitude)."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "In Young's double slit experiment, how is the path difference related to the phase difference?",
      "options": [

        "Δ = (λ/2π)δ",
        "Δ = δλ/(2π)",
        "Δ = 2πδ/λ"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The relationship between path difference Δ and phase difference δ is: Δ = (λ/2π)δ. Since a path difference of one wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of 2π, this relation follows from the proportionality."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What is the condition for bright fringes in terms of path difference?",
      "options": [
        "Δ = (2n+1)λ/2",
        "Δ = nλ, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...",
        "Δ = nλ/2",
        "Δ = (n+1/4)λ"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For bright fringes (constructive interference), the path difference must be an integral multiple of the wavelength: Δ = nλ, where n = 0, 1, 2, ... This corresponds to phase difference of 2nπ."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is the condition for dark fringes in terms of path difference?",
      "options": [
        "Δ = nλ",
        "Δ = (2n+1)λ/2, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...",
        "Δ = nλ/4",
        "Δ = 2nλ"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For dark fringes (destructive interference), the path difference must be an odd multiple of half wavelength: Δ = (2n+1)λ/2, where n = 0, 1, 2, ... This corresponds to phase difference of (2n+1)π."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "In Young's experiment, the path difference at a point on the screen is Δ = S₂P - S₁P. How is this related to the geometry?",
      "options": [
        "Δ = d × D",
        "Δ = d sinθ, or approximately d(x/D)",
        "Δ = (d+D)/x",
        "Δ = x/D"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The path difference is given by Δ = d sinθ, where d is the slit separation and θ is the angle. For small angles, sinθ ≈ x/D, so Δ ≈ dx/D, where x is the distance from the center and D is the distance between slits and screen."

      "question": "What is the formula for the position of bright fringes in Young's double slit experiment?",
      "options": [
        "(xₙ)bright = n(D/d)λ",
        "(xₙ)bright = (n + 1/2)(D/d)λ",
        "(xₙ)bright = n²(D/d)λ",
        "(xₙ)bright = nDλ/d² "
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The position of the nth bright fringe is given by (xₙ)bright = n(D/d)λ, where n = 0, 1, 2, ... and D is the distance to the screen, d is the slit separation, and λ is the wavelength."
    },

        "(xₙ)dark = (n + 1/2)(D/d)λ",
        "(xₙ)dark = n²(D/d)λ",
        "(xₙ)dark = (2n)(D/d)λ"
      ],

      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is fringe width in Young's double slit experiment?",
      "options": [
        "The distance between two consecutive bright fringes",
        "The distance from the central bright fringe to the first dark fringe",
        "The distance between a bright fringe and an adjacent dark fringe",
        "The total width of the interference pattern"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Fringe width (β) is the distance between two consecutive bright fringes (or two consecutive dark fringes). It is given by β = (D/d)λ and remains constant throughout the pattern."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What is the formula for fringe width in Young's experiment?",
      "options": [

        "β = Dλ/d",
        "β = λ/Dd",
        "β = d/Dλ"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The fringe width is given by β = (D/d)λ, where D is the distance to the screen, d is the separation between slits, and λ is the wavelength. It is directly proportional to wavelength and distance, and inversely proportional to slit separation."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What happens to the fringe width if the distance D between the slits and screen is increased?",
      "options": [
        "Fringe width decreases",
        "Fringe width remains constant",
        "Fringe width increases",
        "Fringe width becomes zero"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since β = (D/d)λ, increasing D increases the fringe width. This is because the same path difference corresponds to larger spatial distances on the screen when D is larger."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "What happens to the fringe width if the slit separation d is increased?",
      "options": [
        "Fringe width increases",
        "Fringe width remains constant",
        "Fringe width decreases",
        "Fringe width becomes infinite"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since β = (D/d)λ, increasing d decreases the fringe width. Fringes become closer together as the slit separation increases. This is because the path difference changes more rapidly with position on the screen."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What happens to the interference pattern if the wavelength of light is increased?",
      "options": [
        "Fringe width decreases",
        "Fringe width remains constant",
        "Fringe width increases",
        "No interference pattern is observed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since β = (D/d)λ, increasing the wavelength increases the fringe width. This is why red light (longer wavelength) produces wider fringes than blue light (shorter wavelength) in the same experimental setup."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "In Young's double slit experiment, why do we use a monochromatic source?",
      "options": [
        "To make the experiment easier to perform",
        "To ensure that S₁ and S₂ act as coherent sources",
        "To increase the intensity of light",
        "To reduce the number of fringes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A monochromatic (single wavelength) source is used because when S₁ and S₂ are illuminated by monochromatic light of the same frequency and amplitude, they act as coherent sources and produce a stable interference pattern."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "What is the intensity of bright fringes relative to the intensity of an individual source?",
      "options": [
        "2 times",
        "4 times",
        "Same as individual intensity",
        "Half the individual intensity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "At bright fringes, the intensity is maximum: I = 4a², where a is the amplitude of each individual source. This is because I ∝ A² and the resultant amplitude A = 2a (for waves in phase), so I = (2a)² = 4a²."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "What is the intensity of dark fringes in Young's interference pattern?",
      "options": [
        "Maximum",
        "Half the average intensity",
        "Zero",
        "2a²"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "At dark fringes, the intensity is zero because the two waves are completely out of phase (phase difference = π). The crests of one wave exactly cancel the troughs of the other, resulting in zero displacement and zero intensity."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "How is energy conserved in the interference pattern when dark fringes have zero intensity?",
      "options": [
        "Energy is not conserved in interference",
        "Energy is destroyed at dark fringes",
        "Energy from dark fringes reappears at bright fringes",
        "Energy spreads uniformly across the screen"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The principle of energy conservation is maintained because the energy that disappears at dark fringes reappears at bright fringes. The intensity at bright fringes (4a²) is greater than what would result from two incoherent sources (2a²)."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Can two incandescent light bulbs replace the slits S₁ and S₂ in Young's experiment?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, they produce identical interference patterns",
        "Yes, but with weaker fringes",
        "No, because they emit incoherent light with different wavelengths and no constant phase relationship",
        "No, because they are too bright"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Two incandescent bulbs cannot replace S₁ and S₂ because they emit incoherent light. Independent sources emit different wavelengths, amplitudes, and without constant phase relationship, so no stable interference pattern is observed on the screen."
