  "subtitle": "NIOS Class 12 Physics - Chapter 14: Wave Phenomena",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of musical sound?",
      "options": [
        "Pitch",
        "Loudness",
        "Quality",
        "Velocity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The three main characteristics of musical sound are pitch, loudness, and quality (timbre). Velocity is a property of wave propagation, not a characteristic of musical sound."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is pitch in musical sound?",
      "options": [
        "Strength of sound",
        "Characteristic that enables us to classify sound as high or low",
        "Number of overtones",
        "Quality of sound"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Pitch is the subjective characteristic that enables us to classify musical notes as 'high' or 'low'. It depends on frequency but is not directly proportional to it."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A high-pitched sound has:",
      "options": [
        "High intensity",
        "High frequency",
        "Low amplitude",
        "Low velocity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "High pitch corresponds to high frequency. This is why sounds like a mosquito buzz (high frequency) are perceived as shrill, despite low intensity."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is loudness of sound?",
      "options": [
        "Number of vibrations per second",
        "Distance between successive crests",
        "Subjective effect of intensity received by the listener's ear",
        "Frequency of oscillation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Loudness is how loud or soft a sound seems to the listener, determined by the intensity of the sound wave. It's a subjective perception."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "The intensity of a sound wave is defined as:",
      "options": [
        "Energy per unit volume",
        "Power per unit area per unit time",
        "Average energy transported per unit area per second",
        "Both b and c"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Intensity is the average amount of energy transported by a wave per unit area per second, perpendicular to the direction of propagation. It's expressed in W/m²."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Intensity level in decibels is defined by:",
      "options": [
        "β = 10 log(I/I₀)",
        "β = log(I/I₀)",
        "β = I/I₀",
        "β = 10(I/I₀)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The intensity level β = 10 log(I/I₀), where I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m² is the reference intensity (threshold of hearing). Intensity level is expressed in decibels (dB)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "The threshold of hearing corresponds to an intensity level of:",
      "options": [
        "0 dB",
        "10 dB",
        "20 dB",
        "100 dB"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The threshold of hearing (faintest audible sound) is defined as 0 dB, corresponding to intensity I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m²."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "The threshold of feeling (pain) in the human ear corresponds to approximately:",
      "options": [
        "60 dB",
        "80 dB",
        "100 dB",
        "120 dB"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The threshold of feeling occurs at approximately 120 dB, where sound becomes uncomfortably loud and potentially harmful to hearing."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "The human ear is most sensitive to frequencies in the range:",
      "options": [
        "20-100 Hz",
        "500-1000 Hz",
        "2000-3000 Hz",
        "10000-15000 Hz"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The human ear is most sensitive (lowest threshold) in the frequency range 2000-3000 Hz. This is why sounds in this range are perceived as louder at the same intensity."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is quality (or timbre) of sound?",
      "options": [
        "Intensity of sound",
        "Frequency of sound",
        "Characteristic enabling us to distinguish two notes of same pitch and loudness from different instruments",
        "Velocity of sound"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Quality or timbre is the characteristic that allows us to distinguish between a piano and guitar playing the same note at the same loudness. It depends on the waveform and harmonic content."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Why do different musical instruments produce different quality sounds?",
      "options": [
        "They have different frequencies",
        "They have different amplitudes",
        "They emit fundamental frequency with different combinations of overtones",
        "They all emit pure tones"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Different instruments emit different harmonic combinations along with the fundamental frequency. These overtones create different waveforms, giving each instrument its unique quality."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "A pure tone is emitted by:",
      "options": [
        "Piano",
        "Violin",
        "Tuning fork",
        "Guitar"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A tuning fork is specifically designed to emit a pure tone of one particular frequency with minimal overtones. All other instruments produce complex tones with multiple frequencies."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "At a closed end of an organ pipe, there must be:",
      "options": [
        "An antinode",
        "A node",
        "A crest",
        "A trough"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "At a closed end, air particles cannot move, so there must be a node. At an open end, particles can move freely, so there's an antinode."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "At an open end of an organ pipe, there must be:",
      "options": [
        "A node",
        "An antinode",
        "A pressure maximum",
        "Zero displacement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "At an open end, air can move freely and density changes are zero (continuous with atmosphere). This corresponds to a displacement antinode."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "For an open organ pipe of length L, the fundamental frequency is:",
      "options": [
        "v/L",
        "v/2L",
        "2v/L",
        "4v/L"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "For an open pipe: L = λ/2, so λ = 2L. Since v = νλ, the fundamental frequency ν₁ = v/λ = v/2L."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "For a closed organ pipe of length L, the fundamental frequency is:",
      "options": [
        "v/L",
        "v/2L",
        "2v/L",
        "v/4L"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "For a closed pipe: L = λ/4, so λ = 4L. Since v = νλ, the fundamental frequency ν₁ = v/λ = v/4L."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What is the ratio of fundamental frequencies of an open pipe and a closed pipe of the same length?",
      "options": [
        "1:1",
        "1:2",
        "2:1",
        "4:1"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Open pipe: ν₁ = v/2L; Closed pipe: ν₁ = v/4L. Ratio = (v/2L)/(v/4L) = 2/1 = 2:1."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "In an open organ pipe, the harmonics produced are:",
      "options": [
        "Only odd multiples of fundamental (1st, 3rd, 5th...)",
        "Only even multiples of fundamental (2nd, 4th, 6th...)",
        "All multiples of fundamental (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)",
        "No harmonics, only fundamental"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "An open pipe is rich in harmonics and produces all multiples of the fundamental frequency: ν₁, 2ν₁, 3ν₁, 4ν₁... This makes it richer in overtones."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "In a closed organ pipe, the harmonics produced are:",
      "options": [
        "All multiples of fundamental",
        "Only even multiples (2nd, 4th, 6th...)",
        "Only odd multiples (1st, 3rd, 5th...)",
        "No harmonics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A closed pipe produces only odd harmonics: ν₁, 3ν₁, 5ν₁... The even harmonics are missing. This makes it less rich in overtones compared to an open pipe."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Which organ pipe is richer in overtones?",
      "options": [
        "Closed pipe",
        "Open pipe",
        "Both equally",
        "Depends on length"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Open pipes produce all multiples of fundamental (richer), while closed pipes produce only odd multiples. Therefore, open pipes are richer in overtones and produce more complex tones."
