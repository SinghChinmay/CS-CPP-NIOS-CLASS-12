        "Position",
        "Speed",
        "Velocity",
        "Acceleration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When a constant net external force acts on a body, the acceleration remains constant (F = ma). Position changes with motion, speed may change (unless motion is circular), and velocity changes direction or magnitude. But acceleration remains constant for a constant force on a given mass."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A force F acts on a body of mass m for t seconds. The change in its linear momentum will be:",

        "1 : 2",
        "2 : 1",
        "1 : 4"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "According to Gauss's law, the electric flux through a closed surface depends only on the enclosed charge, not on the size or shape of the surface. Since both surfaces enclose the same charge q, the flux through both is q/ε₀, giving a ratio of 1:1."

        "L/2 and 2D",
        "L and D/2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Resistance R = ρL/A = ρL/(πD²/4). For minimum resistance, we need minimum length and maximum diameter. With L/2 length and 2D diameter, R = ρ(L/2)/(π(2D)²/4) = ρL/(8πD²/4) = R₀/8, which is the minimum."

        "The diffraction fringes become narrower and get crowded together",
        "The diffraction fringes become broader and move further apart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The angular width of diffraction fringes is proportional to wavelength (θ ∝ λ/a). Blue light has shorter wavelength than red light, so the fringes become narrower and more closely spaced."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Hydrogen atoms are excited from ground state to a state with quantum number 4. The maximum number of spectral lines emitted will be:",

        "8",
        "16"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Terminal velocity v ∝ r². Since mass M ∝ r³, we have r ∝ M^(1/3). For mass 8M, r' = 2r. So v' ∝ (2r)² = 4r². Therefore n = 4."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Two spherical drops of the same liquid have their volumes in the ratio 1:8. The ratio of the excess pressures over the atmospheric pressure inside them will be:",
