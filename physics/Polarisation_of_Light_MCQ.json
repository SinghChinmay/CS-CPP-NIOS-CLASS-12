  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is polarisation of light?",
      "options": [
        "The splitting of white light into colors",
        "The phenomenon in which vibrations of light get confined to a particular plane containing the direction of propagation",
        "The bending of light around obstacles",
        "The change in speed of light through different media"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Polarisation of light is the phenomenon in which the electric field vibrations of light are confined to a particular plane containing the direction of propagation. This proved conclusively that light is a transverse wave."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What does polarisation of light prove about the nature of light?",
      "options": [
        "Light is a longitudinal wave",
        "Light travels in straight lines",
        "Light is a transverse wave",
        "Light is a stream of particles"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Polarisation of light conclusively establishes that light is a transverse wave. In longitudinal waves (like sound), particles oscillate along the direction of propagation, so polarisation is not possible. The fact that light can be polarised proves its transverse nature."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "In the activity with two cardboard slits S₁ and S₂, why do waves pass through both when both slits are vertical?",
      "options": [
        "Because the slits are aligned",
        "Because the vibrations in the wave are vertical, parallel to both vertical slits",
        "Because the wave amplitude increases",
        "Because the medium transmits all vibrations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When both slits are vertical, the vibrations in the waves generated by moving the hand up and down are also vertical. These vertical vibrations can pass through the vertical slit S₂, so waves are observed beyond S₂."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "In the cardboard slit activity, what happens when S₁ is vertical and S₂ is horizontal?",
      "options": [
        "More waves pass through S₂",
        "Waves are partially blocked",
        "No waves pass beyond S₂",
        "Waves change color"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When S₁ is vertical (waves with vertical vibrations) and S₂ is horizontal, the waves cannot pass through S₂ because the vibrations are in a plane at right angles to the horizontal slit S₂. This demonstrates that waves have a definite plane of vibration."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is a polaroid?",
      "options": [
        "A type of lens that focuses light",
        "A material made of crystals lined up to transmit light vibrating in one specific plane",
        "A device that splits light into colors",
        "A reflective surface"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A polaroid is a thin sheet made from tiny crystals of quinine iodosulphate lined up in the same direction in nitrocellulose. These dichroic crystals transmit light vibrating in one specific plane and absorb light vibrating in the perpendicular plane."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What happens when unpolarised light passes through a polaroid?",
      "options": [
        "Light intensity remains the same",
        "The light becomes linearly polarised (plane polarised)",
        "The light color changes",
        "The light refracts"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When unpolarised light passes through a polaroid, only the component of light vibrating in the transmission plane of the polaroid passes through. The emergent light is linearly polarised (plane polarised) with vibrations confined to a single plane."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What happens when unpolarised light is reflected from a glass or water surface?",
      "options": [
        "It remains unpolarised",
        "It becomes completely plane polarised",
        "It is partially plane polarised",
        "It loses all intensity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When unpolarised light is reflected from a transparent material like glass or water, the reflected light is partially plane polarised. Complete polarisation occurs only when the incident angle equals the polarising angle."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the polarising angle?",
      "options": [
        "The angle between the incident and reflected rays",
        "The angle at which completely polarised light is reflected",
        "The angle between the normal and the surface",
        "The angle between the refracted and incident rays"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The polarising angle (also called Brewster's angle) is the specific angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely plane polarised. At this angle, there is maximum polarisation of the reflected light."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What is Brewster's law?",
      "options": [
        "μ = sin i / cos i",
        "μ = tan i_p",
        "μ = sin i_p / cos i_p",
        "μ = cos i_p / sin i_p"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Brewster's law states that μ = tan i_p, where μ is the refractive index of the material and i_p is the polarising angle. This relation is derived using Snell's law and the condition that reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular at polarising angle."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the relationship between reflected and refracted rays at the polarising angle?",
      "options": [
        "They are parallel",
        "They are perpendicular to each other",
        "They make 45° with each other",
        "They are in the same direction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "At the polarising angle, the reflected and refracted rays are at right angles (90°) to each other. This geometric condition leads to Brewster's law and complete polarisation of reflected light."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "For an air-water interface, what is the polarising angle?",
      "options": [
        "37°",
        "45°",
        "53°",
        "60°"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "For an air-water interface, the polarising angle i_p = 53°. This means when sunlight is 37° above the horizontal (so the incident angle is 53°), light reflected from a calm pond or lake will be completely linearly polarised."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What practical application does Brewster's law have in daily life?",
      "options": [
        "Designing microscopes",
        "Reducing glare from reflective surfaces using polaroid sunglasses",
        "Creating rainbows",
        "Focusing light beams"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Brewster's law is applied in polaroid sunglasses and coatings on lenses. Polaroid materials reduce glare by absorbing the polarised component of light reflected from smooth surfaces like water or roads, improving visibility and reducing discomfort."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What are dichroic crystals?",
      "options": [
        "Crystals that split light into two colors",
        "Crystals that transmit light in one direction and absorb it in the perpendicular direction",
        "Crystals that double the intensity of light",
        "Crystals that reflect all light"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Dichroic crystals transmit light vibrations along one axis and absorb light vibrations along the perpendicular axis. This property is used in polaroids where dichroic crystals are aligned in the same direction to create polarising material."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "How are polaroid coatings made?",
      "options": [
        "By polishing glass",
        "By coating with oil",
        "By embedding dichroic crystals aligned in the same direction in nitrocellulose",
        "By reflecting light multiple times"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Polaroid coatings are made from tiny dichroic crystals (quinine iodosulphate) that are all lined up in the same direction embedded in a sheet of nitrocellulose. This alignment ensures that only light vibrating in the polaroid's transmission plane passes through."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is the effect of using polaroid filters in photography?",
      "options": [
        "Increases image brightness",
        "Reduces glare and reveals details that would otherwise be hidden",
        "Changes the color of the image",
        "Increases the depth of field"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Polaroid filters in photography reduce glare caused by polarised light reflected from smooth surfaces. By absorbing the polarised component, these filters reveal details and provide better contrast in the photograph that would otherwise be hidden by glare."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is a polarimeter used for?",
      "options": [
        "Measuring the speed of light",
        "Determining the refractive index of materials",
        "Quality control in sugar industry by measuring polarised light",
        "Producing plane polarised light"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A polarimeter is used for quality control in the sugar industry. It measures the rotation of plane polarised light as it passes through a sugar solution, which depends on the concentration and purity of sugar."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What happens when two polaroids are placed with their transmission axes perpendicular to each other?",
      "options": [
        "Maximum light passes through",
        "Light intensity is reduced to half",
        "No light passes through (light is completely blocked)",
        "Light color changes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When two polaroids are placed with their transmission axes perpendicular (at 90°) to each other, light that is polarised by the first polaroid cannot pass through the second because the second polaroid's axis is perpendicular to the polarisation direction. Result: no light emerges."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What is the angle between the transmission axes of two polaroids needed to block light completely?",
      "options": [
        "45°",
        "60°",
        "90° or 270°",
        "180°"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Light is blocked completely when the angle between the transmission axes of two polaroids is 90° (or 270°). At this angle, the polarised light from the first polaroid is perpendicular to the transmission axis of the second, resulting in no light emerging."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Can sound waves in air exhibit polarisation?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, sound waves are always polarised",
        "Yes, sound waves can be polarised by special devices",
        "No, sound waves are longitudinal and cannot be polarised",
        "Only certain frequencies of sound can be polarised"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sound waves in air cannot exhibit polarisation because they are longitudinal waves. Polarisation is a phenomenon unique to transverse waves like light. In longitudinal waves, particles oscillate along the direction of propagation, so there is no concept of a polarisation plane."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Is it possible for the direction of motion of a wave to lie in the plane of polarisation?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, always",
        "Yes, for longitudinal waves only",
        "No, for transverse waves the direction of motion (propagation) is always perpendicular to the plane of polarisation",
        "No, for any type of wave"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "For transverse waves like light, the direction of propagation (motion) is always perpendicular to the plane of polarisation. The plane of polarisation contains the direction of vibration and the direction of propagation, not the actual motion of the wave."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "What does the term 'plane polarised' or 'linearly polarised' light mean?",
      "options": [
        "Light that travels in a plane path",
        "Light whose vibrations are confined to a single plane containing the direction of propagation",
        "Light that has been reflected from a plane surface",
        "Light that travels in a straight line"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Plane polarised (or linearly polarised) light is light whose electric field vibrations are confined to a single plane containing the direction of propagation. After passing through a polaroid, unpolarised light becomes plane polarised."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Why is glare produced when light is reflected from a smooth surface like water?",
      "options": [
        "Because water absorbs some light",
        "Because the reflected light is partially polarised, causing discomfort to the eye",
        "Because water acts as a lens",
        "Because the light intensity increases"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Glare from smooth surfaces like water is produced due to reflected light that is partially or completely plane polarised (depending on angle). This polarised light can cause discomfort to the eyes. Polaroid sunglasses reduce this glare by absorbing the polarised component."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "At what angle of incidence is the reflected light completely polarised for an air-glass interface (n=1.5)?",
      "options": [
        "37°",
        "45°",
        "≈56.3°",
        "60°"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Using Brewster's law: i_p = arctan(μ) = arctan(1.5) ≈ 56.3°. At this polarising angle, the reflected light from the air-glass interface becomes completely plane polarised."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "What is the principle of superposition in the context of polarised light?",
      "options": [
        "Two plane polarised lights always add constructively",
        "Plane polarised light cannot be superposed",
        "Two light waves can superpose regardless of their polarisation states",
        "Two plane polarised lights superpose based on their relative polarisation directions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When two plane polarised light waves superpose, the result depends on their relative polarisation directions. If the polarisation planes are parallel, superposition occurs normally. If perpendicular, they do not interact significantly, and if at an angle, partial superposition occurs."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "How does the refractive index of a material relate to its polarising angle according to Brewster's law?",
      "options": [
        "They are inversely proportional",
        "The refractive index equals the tangent of the polarising angle",
        "The refractive index equals the sine of the polarising angle",
        "They are independent of each other"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to Brewster's law: μ = tan(i_p), where μ is the refractive index and i_p is the polarising angle. This relationship shows that materials with different refractive indices have different polarising angles. For example, water (n=1.33) has i_p≈53°, while glass (n=1.5) has i_p≈56.3°."
