  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Newton's formula for velocity of sound in a gas is v = √(P/ρ). What was Newton's assumption about compression and rarefaction?",
      "options": [
        "Isothermal process",
        "Adiabatic process",
        "Isobaric process",
        "Isochoric process"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Newton assumed that compression and rarefaction occur under isothermal conditions (constant temperature). However, this led to a significant error as the actual process is adiabatic."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the percentage error in Newton's formula when compared to experimental observations for velocity of sound in air?",
      "options": [
        "5%",
        "10%",
        "16%",
        "25%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Using Newton's formula with standard values: (333 - 280)/333 × 100% = 16%. This significant error indicated an error in Newton's assumptions."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Laplace's correction to Newton's formula considers compression and rarefaction as:",
      "options": [
        "Isothermal processes",
        "Adiabatic processes",
        "Slow processes",
        "Rapid isothermal processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Laplace pointed out that sound propagation occurs too rapidly for heat exchange, making the process adiabatic. Using this correction with γ = 1.4 gives v = 333 m/s at STP."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "According to Laplace's formula, the velocity of sound in a gas is v = √(γP/ρ). What is the value of γ for air?",

        "1.4",
        "1.5"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "For air, the heat capacity ratio γ = Cp/Cv = 1.4. This value is used in Laplace's correction formula to give the correct velocity of sound."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "The velocity of sound in air at STP using Laplace's formula is approximately:",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "v = √(1.4 × 1.01 × 10⁵ / 1.29) = 333 m/s at STP, which matches experimental observations very well."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "How does temperature affect the velocity of sound in air?",
      "options": [
        "No effect",
        "Decreases with temperature",
        "Increases with temperature",
        "Increases then decreases"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Velocity of sound increases with temperature. The relationship is approximately v = 333 + 0.61t (m/s) where t is temperature in °C."

        "0.61 m/s",
        "1.0 m/s",
        "2.0 m/s"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For small temperature variations, the velocity increases by approximately 0.61 m/s per degree Celsius, as derived from the relation v ∝ √T."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How does pressure affect the velocity of sound in a gas?",
      "options": [
        "Increases with pressure",
        "Decreases with pressure",
        "No effect",
        "Proportional to square of pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Pressure has no effect on velocity of sound because when pressure increases, density also increases proportionally, keeping P/ρ constant."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "The velocity of sound is inversely proportional to the square root of density. Which gas has the highest velocity of sound among O₂, N₂, and H₂?",
      "options": [
        "O₂",
        "N₂",
        "H₂",
        "All have same velocity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since v ∝ 1/√ρ, hydrogen with the lowest density has the highest velocity. The velocity ratio: v_H₂/v_O₂ = √(M_O₂/M_H₂) = √(32/2) = 4."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "How does humidity affect the velocity of sound in air?",
      "options": [
        "Decreases velocity",
        "Increases velocity",
        "No effect",
        "Only affects frequency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "As humidity increases (with temperature and pressure constant), the density of air decreases, causing the velocity of sound to increase."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "At what temperature is the speed of sound in air double its value at 273 K (STP)?",

        "546 K",
        "819 K",
        "1092 K",
        "1365 K"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since v ∝ √T, if v₂ = 2v₁, then √(T₂/T₁) = 2, so T₂ = 4T₁ = 4 × 273 = 1092 K."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "The velocity of longitudinal waves in an elastic medium is given by:",
      "options": [
        "v = √(E/ρ)",
        "v = E/ρ",
        "v = √(ρ/E)",
        "v = ρ/E"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The velocity of longitudinal waves is v = √(E/ρ), where E is the elastic modulus and ρ is the density. In solids, this velocity is greater than in liquids and gases."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "How are velocities of longitudinal waves in different media related?",
      "options": [
        "vgas > vliquid > vsolid",
        "vsolid > vliquid > vgas",
        "vliquid > vgas > vsolid",
        "All have same velocity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Since elastic modulus is highest in solids and lowest in gases, vsolid > vliquid > vgas. This is because velocity depends on √(E/ρ)."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "For a transverse wave on a stretched string with tension F and mass per unit length m, the velocity is:",
      "options": [
        "v = √(F/m)",
        "v = F/m",
        "v = √(m/F)",
        "v = m/F"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The velocity of transverse waves on a string is v = √(F/m), where F is tension and m is mass per unit length. Higher tension increases velocity, more mass decreases it."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "How does increasing tension in a string affect the velocity of transverse waves?",
      "options": [
        "Decreases",
        "No effect",
        "Increases",
        "Changes only frequency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since v = √(F/m), increasing tension F increases the wave velocity. This is why tightening a guitar string increases both pitch and wave velocity."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "If you increase the linear mass density of a string by replacing it with a heavier string, how does the velocity change?",

        "Increases",
        "Decreases",
        "No change",
        "Becomes infinite"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Since v = √(F/m), increasing mass per unit length (m) decreases velocity. For the same tension, heavier strings have slower wave propagation."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "The velocity of sound in air at 0°C is 332 m/s. What will it be at 20°C?",
      "options": [
        "339.2 m/s",
        "343.0 m/s",
        "345.2 m/s",
        "350.0 m/s"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using v = 333 + 0.61t, at 20°C: v = 333 + 0.61(20) ≈ 343 m/s. (Note: 332 is used as reference in some calculations, giving 343 m/s at 20°C)"
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Why does sound travel faster in solids than in gases?",
      "options": [
        "Solids are denser",
        "Solids have greater elastic modulus",
        "Solids have lower temperature",
        "Gas molecules are moving"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Solids have a much greater elastic modulus (E) compared to gases. Since v = √(E/ρ), the large E value in solids outweighs the density factor, resulting in higher velocity."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "The elastic modulus for transverse waves in a solid is:",
      "options": [
        "Young's modulus",
        "Bulk modulus",
        "Modulus of rigidity",
        "Modulus of tension"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "For transverse waves, the relevant elastic property is the modulus of rigidity (or shear modulus), not Young's modulus which applies to longitudinal waves."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What property of air is bad conductor of heat, making sound propagation adiabatic rather than isothermal?",
      "options": [
        "Low density",
        "Low thermal conductivity",
        "Low specific heat",
        "Low elasticity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Air is a poor conductor of heat due to its low thermal conductivity. Combined with the rapid compression/rarefaction during sound propagation, this prevents significant heat exchange, making the process adiabatic."
