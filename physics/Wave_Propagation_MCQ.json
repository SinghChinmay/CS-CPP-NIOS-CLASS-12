  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the relationship between wave velocity (v), frequency (ν), and wavelength (λ)?",
      "options": [
        "v = ν/λ",
        "v = νλ",
        "v = λ/ν",
        "v = 1/(νλ)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The fundamental wave equation relates velocity, frequency, and wavelength as v = νλ. This shows that wave velocity is the product of frequency and wavelength."
    },

      "id": 2,
      "question": "In a transverse wave on a stretched string, how do particles of the medium move relative to the direction of wave propagation?",
      "options": [
        "In the same direction as the wave",
        "Perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In transverse waves, particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. This is characteristic of transverse waves like those on strings and electromagnetic waves."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The propagation constant k is the phase change per unit distance, given by k = 2π/λ. It describes how the phase changes as you move through space."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "For a longitudinal wave, which of the following represents the displacement-distance relationship?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In longitudinal waves, the displacement-distance graph shows a sinusoidal pattern representing alternate compressions (high density) and rarefactions (low density) in the medium."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the phase difference between two particles in a wave separated by one complete wavelength?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The term (ωt - kx) represents the phase of the wave. At any point (x) and time (t), this determines the instantaneous phase of oscillation at that location."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "If the initial phase angle at the origin is φ₀, the equation of a wave becomes y(x,t) = a sin[(ωt - kx) + φ₀]. What effect does φ₀ have on the wave?",
      "options": [
        "It changes the amplitude",
        "It shifts the wave in space and time",

        "It has no effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The initial phase angle φ₀ introduces a phase shift to the entire wave function, effectively shifting the wave profile in both space and time without changing its fundamental properties like amplitude or frequency."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Angular frequency ω (in radians per second) and frequency ν (in Hz) are related by ω = 2πν. This accounts for the fact that one complete oscillation corresponds to 2π radians."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,

        "Amplitude"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The key distinction is the direction of particle motion. In longitudinal waves, particles move along the direction of propagation, while in transverse waves, they move perpendicular to it."
    },

      "id": 17,
      "question": "A longitudinal wave in a medium can only be transmitted through:",
      "options": [
